# Sam Removals Quote Calculator

This repository contains the standalone multi-step quote calculator used by Sam Removals to capture inventory, locations, access notes, and share a detailed moving quote with clients.

## Steps
1. `quote-calculator.html` — select inventory or enter cubic metres
2. `quote-locations.html` — capture pickup/drop-off details with live routing
3. `quote-friction.html` — free-form access notes for the move planner
4. `quote-final.html` — review pricing with hourly/flat models and shareable summary

All business logic lives in the matching `.js` files. Open `quote-calculator.html` in a browser to start the flow.

## Assets
Brand assets live in `assets/` and are referenced by the HTML files.
